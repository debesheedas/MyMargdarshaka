The *My Margdarshaka* Android app based on the novel concept of connecting Indian school students who are unable to attend traditional school due to financial or logistic constraints with mentors who want to give back to society by teaching them. The idea is to mentor these students with the goal of taking the class 10 and 12 certification exams conducted by the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) which is the Government of India’s official examination body. The app focuses on the UN SDG 4 - Quality Education.

## Data Flow
![Data flow image](https://github.com/debesheedas/MyMargdarshaka/blob/main/data%20flow%20images/data%20flow.png)
The first screen presents you with a set of images that describe what the app is about. There, you can choose to sign in as a student or as a mentor. Based on their choice, the type of user is recorded and transferred in the backend. Now comes the login part, the user enters their phone number, which is also passed to the server. An OTP is generated by Firebase Authentication API which is then verified at the next screen. If they haven’t registered already, we’ll collect the necessary information from the user and store them in the database. If they are a student, mentors will be assigned to them following the algorithm mentioned above. If they are a mentor, we’ll do a quick check if they have cleared the test. A random sample of simple questions are selected from a pool. Based on a threshold score, the mentors will be decided if they’re eligible. If they have cleared the test, they are taken to the page where they can find the students assigned to them, also from the aforementioned algorithm. A feedback button is also provided to the users and potentially be moderated.

# MyMargdarshaka

The *My Margdarshaka* Android app based on the novel concept of connecting Indian school students who are unable to attend traditional school due to financial or logistic constraints with mentors who want to give back to society by teaching them. The idea is to mentor these students with the goal of taking the class 10 and 12 certification exams conducted by the National Institute of Open Schooling(NIOS) which is the Government of Indiaâ€™s official examination body. The app focuses on the UN SDG 4 - Quality Education.
